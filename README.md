# Learn Gen AI Using Java

This repo is sample implementation of Gen AI related functionality using Java, through the use of library like langchain-4j and others.
## Implemented Examples

- Embedding using JinaColbertV2 from Jina AI
- Index the document embedded using JinaColbertV2 using Qdrant Vector DB
- Query the indexed document from qdrant 

## Requirements
I build the project using Java 21+, but should be simple to switch to use other java version such as Java 17, 22 or 23.
